%Fits a sphere to a set of data points using Ransac, Linear Least Squares
%and Non-Linear Least Squares
%Input - Points - 3D points
%        threshold - threshold on ransac to select the inliers
%
%Output - center - center of the sphere (x,y,z)
%         radius - radius of the sphere
%         residual - residual from Non-Linear Least Squares
%         inliers - points on the sphere within the threshold
%         outliers - points not on the sphere
